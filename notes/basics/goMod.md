`go mod` is a command in Go (Golang) that is used to manage dependencies in Go projects. It works with Go modules, which are a way to define and manage project dependencies.

Hereâ€™s a brief overview of the main `go mod` commands:

1. **`go mod init <module-path>`**:
    - Initializes a new module in the current directory. It creates a `go.mod` file.
    - Example: `go mod init github.com/user/project`
2. **`go mod tidy`**:
    - Removes any dependencies that are no longer used in your code and adds any missing ones to the `go.mod` file.
    - Example: `go mod tidy`
3. **`go mod download`**:
    - Downloads the modules needed for the project into the local cache.
    - Example: `go mod download`
4. **`go mod verify`**:
    - Verifies the dependencies against their checksums in `go.sum` to ensure that they have not been altered.
    - Example: `go mod verify`
5. **`go mod vendor`**:
    - Copies all dependencies into a `vendor` directory, which can be included in version control. This is useful when you need to ensure that all dependencies are available even without internet access.
    - Example: `go mod vendor`
6. **`go mod graph`**:
    - Outputs the module dependency graph.
    - Example: `go mod graph`
7. **`go mod edit`**:
    - Allows you to manually edit the `go.mod` file.
    - Example: `go mod edit -require=example.com/module@v1.0.0`
8. **`go mod why <package>`**:
    - Explains why a specific package is required in your project.
    - Example: `go mod why github.com/pkg/errors`

Each of these commands is essential for managing Go modules, ensuring that your project has all the dependencies it needs while keeping the `go.mod` and `go.sum` files clean and accurate.
